You can't power-on the GPU once it's powered off until you restart the system.

To make this simpler, I've set up a few scripts.

Install acpi_call, and add the gpuhandler service from the `voidservices` folder in this repo if you use a runit based system, or move the script and service to their respective places from the GpuDisablerDebianBased directory in this very folder.

use gpuswitch on runit based systems and prime-select on debian based systems to switch.
